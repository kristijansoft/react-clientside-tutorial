## Prerequisites

- SharePoint Online tenant with Office Graph content
- Site Collection created under the **/sites/** or **/**

## Minimal Path to Awesome

- clone this repo
- `$ npm i`
- `$ gulp serve --nobrowser`
- Open workbench on your tennant, ie. https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/salestesm/_layouts/15/workbench.aspx
- Search and add web part "Graph - Eval Url"

## Features

This sample web part shows how URLs in SharePoint can be checked and evaluated agains the Microsoft Graph. This scenario and the introduced class can be use to evluate not only user input but can also be used in the configuration panel of web parts. The benefit is that the URL of the target location remains visible and can be use for debugging reasons to.
The class returns all the Graph objects identified during the evaluation process. It can also be used in backend code.

- using React for building SharePoint Framework Client-side Web Parts
- using Office UI Fabric React components
- create additional custom react components
- access information from the Microsoft Graph using SharePoint Framework version 1.4.1 and above
- using ES6 Promises with vanilla-JavaScript web requests

## Limitations
To identify a list or document library the following two token will be use:

* 'Forms' - View or SharePoint List Form for document libraries
* 'Lists' - SharePoint stores all lists in the sub folder lists so this will be use to identify if a list is present in the URL
