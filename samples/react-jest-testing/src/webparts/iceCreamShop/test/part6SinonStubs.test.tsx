// Remarks: In general the last test has two timeouts due void handlers
// of the react component handlers. It has to wait the first time for 
// componentDidMount to load the ice creams list, but then has to wait 
// with setTimeout for the buyHandler to complete because it is void.
/// If the buyHandler was promise, then this would remove
// the need of a second timeout function.
