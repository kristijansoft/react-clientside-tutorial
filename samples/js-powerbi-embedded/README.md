## Features

The _PowerBI Embedded_ Client-Side Web Part is built on the SharePoint Framework using React and uses [PowerBI Embedded](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/power-bi-embedded/) to securely display a report.
All authentication and rendering happens client-side, there is no server-side component required.

It uses the [PowerBI Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/powerbi-client) for rendering the PowerBI report.
