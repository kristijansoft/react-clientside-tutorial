# Workbench customizer

## Summary

This sample shows how the Workbench page can be customized to display in a way that better mimics a modern SharePoint page.
This is done using CSS overrides on some of the page styles, which does not cause any negative impact on your site as the web part is not intended to be consumed by final users, only developers.
The web part also has some properties that control which customizations are applied to the workbench page (all enabled by default).
