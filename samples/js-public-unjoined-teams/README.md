## Features

This web part lists all the public teams the current user is not yet a member of. They can then join any of those teams by clicking the button right next to the team name. The Teams client does not present this kind of a complete list by default, so the web part is particularly handy to all end users who might not even be aware of all the public teams that are available. This web part can also be added to Teams as a tab. The web part colors are based on the site color theme.
