## Web part displaying hierarchical information from SharePoint list

### Summary 
At the time of developing this sample, the Office 365 UI fabric does not have any control for displaying hierarchical information. This web part helps to display the hierarchical information from SharePoint list.

The web part is configured to render the mock data when added to local SharePoint workbench.

When added to SharePoint site, the source list containing hierarchical information can be configured from web part properties.
The sample also provisions the list called “Hierarchy” which can be used as an example to start using the web part.

### SharePoint Asset
A SharePoint list (named Hierarchy) is provisioned to store the hierarchical data. The schema of the list is as below.
