# Script editor web part for modern pages built in React

## Summary
Coming from old classic SharePoint pages you might have existing script solutions you want to re-use on a modern page
without having to repackage it as a new SharePoint Framework web part. This web part is similar to the classic
Script Editor Web Part, and allows you do drop arbitrary script or html on a modern page.

> Notice. All client-side web parts are deployed or enabled to be available in site level by tenant administrator using tenant app catalog. If there are concerns on enabling script options in a tenant, this web part or a approach should not be approved by tenant administrators.

As an example add the following scripts to the web part in order to show stock ticker info on your page. First *tv.js* is loaded, and then the script block is executed to show the ticker information.

```html
<!-- TradingView Widget BEGIN -->
<div class="tradingview-widget-container">
    <div id="tradingview_ab4e5"></div>
    <div class="tradingview-widget-copyright"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-MSFT/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span class="blue-text">MSFT chart</span></a> by TradingView</div>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/tv.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    new TradingView.widget({
        "width": 400,
        "height": 200,
        "symbol": "NASDAQ:MSFT",
        "interval": "D",
        "timezone": "Etc/UTC",
        "theme": "Light",
        "style": "1",
        "locale": "en",
        "toolbar_bg": "#f1f3f6",
        "enable_publishing": false,
        "allow_symbol_change": true,
        "container_id": "tradingview_ab4e5"
    });
</script>
<!-- TradingView Widget END -->
```

The web part works by loading each script in a `<script src>` tag sequentially in the order they are specified, then any other `<script>` block is executed.

If you for some reason need the script to force load on each new page, add the attribute `reload` to the script tag.
This will reload the script even on smart modern page loads.
```html
<script src="myscript.js" reload></script>
```

If all you want is to add markup on the page, you can do that as well. Adding the following html would show a headline and a list.

```html
<h2>My header</h2>
<ul>
    <li>One
    <li>Two
    <li>Three
</ul>
```

You may add CSS via style tags or `link` tags.
```html
<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous">
<style>
    #container h1 {
        color: red;
    }
</style>
<div id="container">
    <h1>Headline</h1>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">.col-md-8</div>
    <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
    <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
    <div class="col-md-4">.col-md-4</div>
</div>
```

## Support for classic _spPageContextInfo
If your scripts rely on the classic _spPageContextInfo, you can enable that in the web part property pane.

## Minimal Path to Awesome
### Local testing

- Clone this repository
- In the command line run:
  - `npm install`
  - `gulp serve`

### Deploy
* Set CDN path in config\write-manifest.json to where you want to host the web part
	* E.g.:  https://&lt;tenant&gt;.sharepoint.com/sites/CDN/SiteAssets/SPFx/&lt;partname&gt;
* gulp --ship
* gulp package-solution --ship
* Copy contents of temp\deploy to the CDN folder
* Upload .sppkg file from sharepoint\solution to your tenant App Catalog
	* E.g.: https://&lt;tenant&gt;.sharepoint.com/sites/AppCatalog/AppCatalog
* Add the web part to a site collection, and test it on a page

### Deploy to non-script sites / modern team sites
By default this web part is not allowed on no-script sites, as it allows execution of arbitrary script. This is by design as from a security and governance perspective you might not want arbitrary script added to your pages. This is typically something you want control over.

If you however want to allow the web part for non-script sites like Office 365 Group modern team sites you have to edit `ScriptEditorWebPart.manifest.json` with the following change:
```
"requiresCustomScript": false
```

### Deploy tenant wide
By default you have to install this web part per site collection where you want it availble. If you want it enabled by default on all sites you have to edit `package-solution.json` with the following change:
```
"skipFeatureDeployment": true
```

In order to make it availble to absolutely all sites you need apply the _Deploy to non-script sites / modern team site_ change as well.

## Features
This web part illustrates the following concepts on top of the SharePoint Framework:

- Re-use existing JavaScript solutions on a modern page
- Office UI Fabric
- React
