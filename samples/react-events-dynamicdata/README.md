## Features

This sample contains a set of SharePoint Framework client-side web parts that illustrate the Dynamic data capability.

Web parts in this solution illustrate the following concepts on top of the SharePoint Framework:

* making web part a dynamic data source
* exposing multiple data properties from a single data source
* subscribing to dynamic data source notifications from a web part
* deploying list instances from a SharePoint Framework solution package
* using [PnPjs](https://github.com/pnp/pnpjs) to retrieve data from a SharePoint list
* using [SharePoint Framework React Controls](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-controls-react) in web parts
