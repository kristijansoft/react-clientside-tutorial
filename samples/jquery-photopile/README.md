# JQuery, Photopile.JS & Office UI Fabric Client-Side Web Part

## Summary

This is a sample web part that illustrated the use of JQuery and  [Photopile.Js](https://github.com/bigbhowell/Photopile-JS)
with the SharePoint Framework.

With this web part you can display the photos contained in a SharePoint pictures library and it
simulates a pile of photos scattered about on a surface. Thumbnail clicks remove photos from the pile,
(enlarging them as if being picked up by the user) and once in view a second click returns the photo to the pile.
