## Angular MS Graph Web Part Built with Angular v1.x

## Summary
This is a sample MS Graph web part that connects to Microsoft Graph and pulls SharePoint information from your
tenant. It will first pull the root site collection (currently a limitation by Microsoft Graph), then it will
display all the lists associated with the site followed by all the items inside the list.
